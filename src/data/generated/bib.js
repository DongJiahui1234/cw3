        "abstract": "The influence of human-care service robots in human\u2013robot interaction is becoming of great importance, because of the roles that the robots are taking in today\u2019s and future society. Thus, we need to identify how humans can interact, collaborate, and learn from social robots more efficiently. Additionally, it is important to determine the robots\u2019 modalities that can increase the humans\u2019 perceived likeness and knowledge acquisition and enhance human\u2013robot collaboration. The present study aims to identify the optimal social service robots\u2019 modalities that enhance the human learning process and level of enjoyment from the interaction and even attract the humans\u2019 attention to choosing a robot to collaborate with it. Our target group was college students, pre-service teachers. For this purpose, we designed two experiments, each one split in two parts. Both the experiments were between groups, and human participants had the chance to watch the Nao robot performing a storytelling exercise about the history of robots in a museum-educational activity via video annotations. The robot\u2019s modalities were manipulated on its body movements (expressive arm and head gestures) while performing the storytelling, friendly attitude expressions and storytelling, and personality traits. After the robot\u2019s storytelling, participants filled out a knowledge acquisition questionnaire and a self-reported enjoyment level questionnaire. In the second part, we introduce the idea of participants witnessing a conversation between the robots with the different modalities, and they were asked to choose the robot with which they want to collaborate in a similar activity. Results indicated that participants prefer to collaborate with robots with a cheerful personality and expressive body movements. Especially when they were asked to choose between two robots that were cheerful and had expressive body movements, they preferred the one which originally told them the story. Moreover, participants did not prefer to collaborate with a robot with an extremely friendly attitude and storytelling style.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research project is to develop a smart social robot showing sufficient intelligence to work as a tour-guide in different environments. In doing so, both a software and a hardware architecture are proposed, the different modules of which, such as a laser, cameras, platform, face, and voice, among others, control the different components of the robot. Those components are in turn used by other modules designed for navigation and interaction. A sensor fusion for the purposes of localization is implemented by means of an Extended Kalman Filter, which is one of the navigation module components, together with the proposed fuzzy controllers needed for path following. A fuzzy emotion system that controls the face and the voice modules also forms part of this architecture for assisting interaction. Finally, all the modules are controlled with a customized programming language that is a mixture of C, Pascal, and JavaScript. The modules are optimized for immediate execution to achieve realistic human\u2013machine interaction.",

        "abstract": " This study empirically explores passengers\u2019 emotional experience of using airport service robots from the perspective of the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. Our proposed model hypothesizes that stimuli, which is the functional value and coolness of using the airport service robots, leads to satisfaction and influences responses such as perceived smartness and word-of-mouth of the airport. A survey sample of 321 respondents with use experience of airport service robot were employed for the analysis. The result reveals that only perceived coolness of service robot is positively related to satisfaction. Satisfaction demonstrated positive and significant effects on perceived smartness and word-of-mouth of the airport. Engagement of service robots in airport service activities is found to contribute to positive emotional experiences and favorable perspectives of the airport. Empirical implications are discussed and provided.",

        "abstract": "The use of the Zora robot was monitored and evaluated in 14 nursing care organizations (15 locations). The Zora robot, a N\u00e3o robot with software, is designed as a social robot and used for pleasure and entertainment or to stimulate the physical activities of clients in residential care. In the first year, the aim was to monitor and evaluate how the care robot is used in daily practice. In the second year, the focus was on evaluating whether the use of Zora by care professionals can be extended to more groups and other type of clients. Interviews, questionnaires and observations were used as instruments to reveal the progress in the use of the robot and to reveal the facilitators and barriers. Care professionals experienced several barriers in the use of the robot (e.g., start-up time and software failures). The opportunity they had to discuss their experience during project team meetings was seen as a facilitator in the project. Furthermore, they mentioned that the Zora robot had a positive influence on clients as it created added value for the care professionals in having fun at work.",

        "abstract": "For a service robot to serve travelers at an airport or for a social robot to live with a human partner at home, it is vital for robots to possess the ability to empathize with human partners and express congruent emotions accordingly. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding empathy in interpersonal, virtual agents, and social robots research with inclusion criteria to analyze empirical studies in a peer-reviewed journal, conference proceeding, or a thesis. Based on the review, we define empathy for human\u2013robot interaction (HRI) as the robot\u2019s (observer) capability and process to recognize the human\u2019s (target) emotional state, thoughts, and situation, and produce affective or cognitive responses to elicit a positive perception of humans. We reviewed all prominent empathy theories and established a conceptual framework that illuminates critical components to consider when designing an empathic robot, including the empathy process, outcome, and the observer and target characteristics. This model is complemented by empirical research involving empathic virtual agents and social robots. We suggest critical factors such as domain dependency, multi-modality, and empathy modulation to consider when designing, engineering, and researching empathic social robots.",

        "abstract": "Using Automated Planning for the high level control of robotic architectures is becoming very popular thanks mainly to its capability to define the tasks to perform in a declarative way. However, classical planning tasks, even in its basic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) format, are still very hard to formalize for non expert engineers when the use case to model is complex. Human Robot Interaction (HRI) is one of those complex environments. This manuscript describes the rationale followed to design a planning model able to control social autonomous robots interacting with humans. It is the result of the authors\u2019 experience in modeling use cases for Social Assistive Robotics (SAR) in two areas related to healthcare: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and non-contact rehabilitation therapies for patients with physical impairments. In this work a general definition of these two use cases in a unique planning domain is proposed, which favors the management and integration with the software robotic architecture, as well as the addition of new use cases. Results show that the model is able to capture all the relevant aspects of the Human-Robot interaction in those scenarios, allowing the robot to autonomously perform the tasks by using a standard planning-execution architecture.",
